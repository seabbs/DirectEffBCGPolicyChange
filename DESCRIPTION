Description: The Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine is the mostly widely used vaccine globally, however its efficacy remains contentious. In 2005, England changed from universal vaccination of school-age children to targeted vaccination of high-risk children at birth, identified by local Tuberculosis (TB) incidence and by the parents’ country of origin. The impact of this policy change has not been evaluated.
